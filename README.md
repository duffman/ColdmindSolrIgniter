Apache SOLR Client implemented in TypeScript

This is not really a crack shot at re-inventing the wheel, fact is, there is
really no decent TypeScript implementations (or JavaScript for that matter).

The ones that exist are (in my professional oppinion) written by happy amateurs
slobbing away with resources, appending chunks of strings to a soup of unreadable
crap, some of them actually claim to be core libraries while relying on the
browser DOM (WTF?) IÂ´m not naming anyone and by this claim I put some
preassure on myself and this project, right? anyhow... this will be a professional
enterprise level library that...

...aims to implement a lightweight stand alone (with minimal dependencies)
TypeScript Client for the Apache SOLR Search Server.

The current goal is to implement the very basic functionality before
digging into features such as GEO and TypeAhead

Must have features

* Query
* Widcard Searches (obviously)
* Typed Query Results
* Typed Documents
* Basic Caching
* Support for the BasicAuth Plugin

Help would be appreciated :)
